1. Project Objective:
The goal is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable (housing prices). You'll be using the Boston Housing dataset, which contains various features of houses and their corresponding median values
2. Project Workflow:
a. Data Collection:
Boston Housing Dataset: This dataset contains information about various houses in Boston, including features like:
Crime rate
Number of rooms
Proximity to schools and other amenities
Average income in the area
House prices (target variable)
The dataset is widely available through libraries like sklearn.datasets or Kaggle.
b. Data Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values or incorrect data if present.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize the features to improve the performance of the linear regression model.
Feature Selection: Select features that have the most significant impact on house prices, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
c. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Correlation Analysis: Check how each feature is correlated with the target variable (house price). You can use heatmaps and scatterplots for this.
Visualizations: Create visualizations (scatter plots, box plots) to explore relationships between features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and the housing prices.
d. Train-Test Split:
Divide the data into training and testing sets. Typically, the data is split into 70% for training and 30% for testing.
Ensure that the target variable (housing prices) is also split accordingly.
e. Model Implementation:
Linear Regression Model: Use a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on features.
f. Model Evaluation:
Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics like:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted prices.
R-squared Score: Indicates how well the independent features explain the variance in the target variable.
Model Validation: Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
g. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):
In case you want to improve model performance, you could apply feature transformations or polynomial regression if the relationship is not strictly linear.
h. Model Interpretation:
Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the impact of each feature on housing prices.
3. Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language.
Libraries:
pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
scikit-learn for implementing the linear regression model, data preprocessing, and evaluation.
5. Challenges and Considerations:
Assumption of Linearity: Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target, which may not always be true in real-world datasets.
Feature Engineering: Sometimes, additional feature engineering or transforming non-linear relationships is needed.
Outliers: Outliers can distort the linear regression model, so they need to be handled carefully.
6. Extensions and Improvements:
Polynomial Regression: If the relationship between the features and the target is non-linear.
Regularization: Use techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to reduce overfitting.
Model Comparison: Compare linear regression with other machine learning models like decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines.
